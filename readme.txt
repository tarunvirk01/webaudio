a) I choose Web audio because I am interested in music, and also have made beats on my own for a while. I thought this project would be a 
good way to jump into and learn about web audio api.

b) When I started this project I did not know a whole lot about web audio api, but I had earlier used the audio tags in my projects.
That's about it.

c) The resources that helped me are: 
	* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API
	* https://www.npmjs.com/package/dilla
	* http://webaudioapi.com/samples/
	* http://adamrenklint.com/making-boombap-beat-with-dilla/
d) The most challenging part was setting up the project. Dilla used npm, so I had to learn a bit about it. 
Download node. I also had to figure out how to sequence the kicks and snares, as the documentation did not tell me what [x.x.xx] meant, 
so i had to play around with the sequence a bit to figure out the correct timings.
